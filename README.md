# Main.py explanation

Funcion getXML, is relative to exercise 1;

About exercise 6, even though it was optional, I tried to do it but in the end I couldn't solve it . My main problem was getting the csv with the lambda function, since I couldn't search it in my local files, I tried different methods but unfortunatelly none of them worked. It was my first time working with Amazon Web Services (AWS).
